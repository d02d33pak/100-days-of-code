# 100 Days Of Code - Log :bookmark_tabs: :computer:


### Day 18: July 29, Saturday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Looking at ways to optimize older code.

_**Thoughts:**_ Learned my lesson, BRUTE-FORCE method doesn't work when it comes to Competitive Programming.

---

### Day 17: July 28, Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Competed in _*TCS CodeVita*_.

_**Thoughts:**_ Had a 6 hours window to solve 6 problems (or as many as I could). I feel I need to work *_a lot more_* on my proramming skills. Was able to solve just one problem that too with output exceeding TIME LIMIT.

---

### Day 16: July 27, Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced/Solved problems from CodeChef

_**Thoughts:**_ Still Practicing for _*TCS CodeVita*_.

---

### Day 15: July 26, Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced/Solved problems from CodeChef

_**Thoughts:**_ Practicing for _*TCS CodeVita*_.
---

### Day 14: July 25, Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced/Solved problems from CodeChef

_**Thoughts:**_ I have this coding competition *'TCS CodeVita'* coming up on 28th. So, I think I should practice as much as I can.

---

### Day 13: July 24, Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Integrated Google Sign-In into Evento

_**Thoughts:**_ May look like a simple task to others but took me well over an hour to integrate it. I think I need to start taking Java tutorials.

---

### Day 12: July 23, Sunday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced problems from ProjectEuler

_**Thoughts:**_ Didn't have much time to code. So, re-did/optimised solution for previously solved problem.

---

### Day 11: July 22, Saturday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my final year project - Evento - android app for local events for college students.

_**Thoughts:**_ Struggling a bit because Java isn't my language of preference. Lots of Googling.

---

### Day 10: July 21, Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced/Solved problems from CodeChef

_**Thoughts:**_ Stepping up was indeed a challenge. Could not solve the problem even after trying for so long. Need to learn to optimize code for faster exectuion. 

---

### Day 09: July 20, Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced/Solved problems from CodeChef

_**Thoughts:**_ Have started to feel confident while thinking/developing algo for such problems. Stepping up a level for the next problem. 

---

### Day 08: July 19, Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created my first ever python script to srape problem statements ProjectEuler.net

_**Thoughts:**_ After searching for a while I came up with a simple script that would save all the problem statements from projecteuler.net into a text file. And made an android application that would view this textfile.

---

### Day 07: July 18, Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced on CodeChef

_**Thoughts:**_ Practice, practice and some more practice.

---

### Day 06: July 17, Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced on CodeChef

_**Thoughts:**_ Nothing really new to share. Still continues to make silly mistakes. Hopes to improve.

---

### Day 05: July 16, Sunday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Registered for HackerEarth's 'THINK-A-THON'. Solved around 25 MCQs(Multiple Choice Questions).

_**Thoughts:**_ The questions(MCQs) were in Java, C/C++ and Perl. Even though I'm not much used to Java and Perl(not at all in case of Perl), I managed to solve most of the questions. Brushed-up some of my basics in C/C++.

---

### Day 04: July 15, Saturday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued CodeChef's July challenge.

_**Thoughts:**_ Biting my fingernails to come up with a solution. Finally manages to. But getting TLE(Time Limit Exceeded) and WA(Wrong Anwer) for some(most of them :sweat_smile:) test cases. Will try to debug. As always, have statred to doubt my programming skills.

---

### Day 03: July 14, Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for CodeChef's July challenge.

_**Thoughts:**_ My first attempt at any of the CodeChef's coding challeges.

---

### Day 02: July 13, Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried solving problems from CodeChed (coded for around 1.5 hours).

_**Thoughts:**_ Sat down to solve this problem that I haven't been able to solve for quite some time. Tried and tried different approaches but couldn't break through. Tired, going to sleep. Progress? I don't know.

---

### Day 01: July 12, Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Problems 05 to 08 from EulerProject.net.

_**Thoughts:**_ Solving the problem mathematically (ofcourse) and then coming up with a code implementing the brute-force method to check the logic and then thinking ways to optimize the program so as to effectively improve execution time.

---

### Day 00: July 11, Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Problem 01, 02, 03 and 04 from EulerProject.net.

_**Thoughts:**_ Focused on optimization of programs submitted.
