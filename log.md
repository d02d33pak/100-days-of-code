### Day 001: July 12, Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Problems 05 to 08 from EulerProject.net.

_**Thoughts:**_ Solving the problem mathematically (ofcourse) and then coming up with a code implementing the brute-force method to check the logic and then thinking ways to optimize the program so as to effectively improve execution time.

### Day 002: July 13, Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried solving a problem from CodeChed (coded for around 1.5 hours).

_**Thoughts:**_ Sat down to solve this problem that I haven't been able to solve for quite some time. Tried and tried different approaches but couldn't break through. Tired, going to sleep. Progress? I don't know.
